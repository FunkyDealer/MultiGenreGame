# MultiGenreGame
A project where you can find multiple genre of games in one package. assets are unity's default shapes.

FPS (First person Shooter):
The FPS found in this project is similar to quake. with fast movement, jumping, crouching and the addition of a wall grab mechanic.
the player starts with no weapons, but can pick up a Machine gun (assigned to slot 2), a Shotgun, (assigned to slot 3) and a ricochet laser gun (assigned to slot 5)

the ricochet laser gun's laser ricochets off walls various times.
the player can jump with the Space bar and crouch with Ctrl. 
if the player crouches mid-air, they will try to grab a nearby wall. keep ctrl pressed to stay on the wall. you can also press space again to jump from the wall (you will jump up)
there are enemies that can be killed (they currently have no AI)

ARPG (Action Role Playing Game):
the ARPG controls like diablo, the camera is looking down on the player and you can click the environment to order them to move.
clicking an enemy will make the player move to a suitable range that allows them to shoot projectiles, damaging them and killing them.
the camera is always following the player.

RTS (Real Time Strategy):
The RTS has a top down camera that the player can move around with WASD. when you start the game, a unit will spawn where the camera is looking at.
you can select units by either single clicking them with the left mouse button, or by creating a selection box by clicking with the left mouse button and then dragging it.

after selecting a unit, you can order it to move by right clicking on the environment.

TBT (Turn-Based Tactics):
the TBT game has a top down camera that the player can move around with WASD. it features square grid based gameplay simiar to disgaea.
the player can select squares by left clicking on them. 
when the game starts, a unit on the player's team will spawn on the bottom right of the field. move the camera to see it, and click on the square where it the unit is.
you can move the unit by right clicking on one of the squares that light up.
Press enter to end turns

GTS (Ghost in the shell)
this is a prototype for a game based on the "ghost in the shell" game from 1997 for the playstation
The main feature is that the player turns into corners when walking into them, meaning that you can walk on walls, ceilings or any surface.

(the files for the TBT game are named "TST" by mistake)
